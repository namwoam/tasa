High aspect ratio wings provide additional lift and drag reduction for a proposed multi-propulsor design, however, the challenge is to reduce the weight of wing structures while maintaining adequate structural and aeroelastic margins. Design exploration using a conventional design-and-build philosophy coupled with a finite element method (FEM)-based design of experiments (DOE) strategy are presented to examine high aspect ratio wing structures that have spanwise distributed electric motors. Multiple leading-edge-mounted engine masses presented a challenge to design a wing within acceptable limits for dynamic and aeroelastic stability. Because the first four primary bending eigenmodes of the proposed wing structure are very sensitive to outboard motor placement, safety-of-flight requirements drove the need for multiple spars, rib attachments, and outboard structural reinforcements in the design. Global aeroelasticity became an increasingly important design constraint during the on-going design process, with outboard motor pod flutter ultimately becoming a primary design constraint. Designers successively generated models to examine stress, dynamics, and aeroelasticity concurrently. This research specifically addressed satisfying multi-disciplinary design criteria to generate fluid-structure interaction solution sets, and produced high aspect ratio primary structure designs for the NASA Scalable Convergent Electric Propulsion Technology and Operations Research (SCEPTOR) project in the Aeronautic Research Mission Directorate at NASA. In this paper, a dynamics-driven, quasi-inverse design methodology is presented to address aerodynamic performance goals and structural challenges encountered for the SCEPTOR demonstrator vehicle.

Motivated by Digital Twin, a structural health management (SHM) paradigm that integrates vehicle-specific characteristics with continual in-situ damage diagnosis and prognosis, the methods studied herein yield near real-time damage assessments that could enable monitoring of a vehicle's health while it is operating (i.e. online SHM). High-fidelity modeling and uncertainty quantification (UQ), both critical to Digital Twin, are incorporated using finite element method simulations and Bayesian inference, respectively. The crux of the proposed Bayesian diagnosis methods, however, is the reformulation of the numerical sampling algorithms (e.g. Markov chain Monte Carlo) used to generate the resulting probabilistic damage estimates. To this end, three distinct methods are demonstrated for rapid sampling that utilize surrogate modeling and exploit various degrees of parallelism for leveraging HPC. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the methods are compared on the problem of strain-based crack identification in thin plates.

This report summarizes several lessons learned from the rapid design portion of the study. This effort entailed learning and applying design thinking, a human-centered design approach, to complete the conceptual design for an open-ended design challenge within six months. The design challenge focused on creating a capability to advance experimental testing of autonomous aeronautics systems, an area of great interest to NASA, the US government as a whole, and an entire ecosystem of users and developers around the globe. A team of nine civil servant researchers from three of NASA's aeronautics field centers with backgrounds in several disciplines was assembled and rapidly trained in design thinking under the guidance of the innovation and design firm IDEO. The design thinking process, while used extensively outside the aerospace industry, is less common and even counter to many practices within the aerospace industry. In this report, several contrasts between common aerospace research and development practices and design thinking are discussed, drawing upon the lessons learned from the NASA rapid design study. The lessons discussed included working towards a design solution without a set of detailed design requirements, which may not be practical or even feasible for management to ascertain for complex, challenging problems. This approach allowed for the possibility of redesigning the original problem statement to better meet the needs of the users. Another lesson learned was to approach problems holistically from the perspective of the needs of individuals that may be affected by advances in topic area instead of purely from a technological feasibility viewpoint. The interdisciplinary nature of the design team also provided valuable experience by allowing team members from different technological backgrounds to work side-by-side instead of dividing into smaller teams, as is frequently done in traditional multidisciplinary design. The team also learned how to work with qualitative data obtained primarily through the 70-plus interviews that were conducted over the course of this project, which was a sharp contrast to using quantitative data with regards to identifying, capturing, analyzing, storing, and recalling the data. When identifying potential interviewees who may have useful contributions to the design subject area, the team found great value in talking to non-traditional users and potential beneficiaries of autonomous aeronautics systems whose impact on the aeronautics autonomy ecosystem is growing swiftly. Finally, the team benefitted from using \"sacrificial prototyping,\" which is a method of rapidly prototyping draft concepts and ideas with the intent of enabling potential users to provide significant feedback early in the design process. This contrasts the more common approach of using expensive prototypes that focus on demonstrating technical feasibility. The unique design approach and lessons learned by the team throughout this process culminated in a final design concept that was quite different than what the team originally assumed would be the design concept initially. A summary of the more usercentered final design concept is also provided."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001317", "NF1676L-24883", "AIAA Paper No. 2569919"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["2017 AIAA SciTech Forum; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001317"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["No Copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Aircraft Design, Testing and Performance"], "subject.NASATerms": ["PROTOTYPES", "UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS", "AIRCRAFT DESIGN", "TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT", "PILOTLESS AIRCRAFT", "DESIGN ANALYSIS", "AUTONOMY", "RAPID PROTOTYPING", "LESSONS LEARNED", "PROBLEM SOLVING", "QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS", "TEST STANDS", "NASA PROGRAMS", "EXPERIMENT DESIGN", "FEASIBILITY", "SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION", "MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN OPTIMIZATION", "DEFINITION", "FEEDBACK"], "title": ["Lessons Learned from Applying Design Thinking in a NASA Rapid Design Study in Aeronautics"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

While emissions scenarios indicating the range of N2O's potential future contributions to radiative forcing are widely available, the impact of these emissions scenarios on future stratospheric ozone depletion is less clear. This is because N2O's ozone destructiveness is partially dependent on tropospheric warming, which affects ozone depletion rates in the stratosphere. Consequently, in order to understand the possible range of stratospheric ozone depletion that N2O could cause over the 21st century, it is important to decouple the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and compare different emissions trajectories for individual substances (e.g. business-as-usual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions versus low emissions of N2O). This study is the first to follow such an approach, running a series of experiments using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Sciences ModelE2 atmospheric sub-model. We anticipate our results to show that stratospheric ozone depletion will be highest in a scenario where CO2 emissions reductions are prioritized over N2O reductions, as this would constrain ozone recovery while doing little to limit stratospheric NOx levels (the breakdown product of N2O that destroys stratospheric ozone). This could not only delay the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, but might also prevent a return to pre-1980 global average ozone concentrations, a key goal of the international ozone regime.

Planning is underway to enhance and transform the infrastructure over the coming decade. Key to the upgrade will be the simultaneous and efficient use of relay transponders to minimize cost and operations while supporting science and exploration spacecraft. Efficient use of transponders necessitates bandwidth efficient communications to best use and maximize data throughput within the allocated spectrum. Experiments conducted with NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Testbed on the International Space Station provides a unique opportunity to evaluate advanced communication techniques, such as bandwidth-efficient modulations, in an operational flight system. Demonstrations of these new techniques in realistic flight conditions provides critical experience and reduces the risk of using these techniques in future missions. Efficient use of spectrum is enabled by using high-order modulations coupled with efficient forward error correction codes. This paper presents a high-rate, bandwidth-efficient waveform operating over the 225 MHz Ka-band service of the TDRS System (TDRSS). The testing explores the application of Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK), 2/4/8-phase shift keying (PSK) and 16/32- amplitude PSK (APSK) providing over three bits-per-second-per-Hertz (3 b/s/Hz) modulation combined with various LDPC encoding rates to maximize through- put.

As such, it simulates the propagation of failure effects along paths between the origin of the system failure modes and points within the system capable of observing the failure effects. As a result, FFMs may be used to diagnose the presence of failures in the modeled system. FFMs necessarily contain a significant amount of information about the design, operations, and failure modes and effects. One of the important benefits of FFMs is that they may be qualitative, rather than quantitative and, as a result, may be implemented early in the design process when there is more potential to positively impact the system design. FFMs may therefore be developed and matured throughout the monitored system's design process and may subsequently be used to provide real-time diagnostic assessments that support system operations. This paper provides an overview of a generalized NASA process that is being used to develop and apply FFMs. FFM technology has been evolving for more than 25 years. The FFM development process presented in this paper was refined during NASA's Ares I, Space Launch System, and Ground Systems Development and Operations programs (i.e., from about 2007 to the present). Process refinement took place as new modeling, analysis, and verification tools were created to enhance FFM capabilities. In this paper, standard elements of a model development process (i.e., knowledge acquisition, conceptual design, implementation & verification, and application) are described within the context of FFMs. Further, newer tools and analytical capabilities that may benefit the broader systems engineering process are identified and briefly described.

The cFS is a flexible, open architecture that features a plugand- play software executive called the Core Flight Executive (cFE), a reusable library of software components for flight and space missions and an integrated tool suite.

In particular, a next generation composite impact material model, jointly developed by the FAA and NASA, is being implemented into the commercial transient dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA. The material model, which incorporates plasticity, damage, and failure, utilizes experimentally based tabulated input to define the evolution of plasticity and damage and the initiation of failure as opposed to specifying discrete input parameters (such as modulus and strength). The plasticity portion of the orthotropic, three-dimensional, macroscopic composite constitutive model is based on an extension of the Tsai-Wu composite failure model into a generalized yield function with a non-associative flow rule. For the damage model, a strain equivalent formulation is utilized to allow for the uncoupling of the deformation and damage analyses. In the damage model, a semi-coupled approach is employed where the overall damage in a particular coordinate direction is assumed to be a multiplicative combination of the damage in that direction resulting from the applied loads in the various coordinate directions. Due to the fact that the plasticity and damage models are uncoupled, test procedures and methods to both characterize the damage model and to covert the material stress-strain curves from the true (damaged) stress space to the effective (undamaged) stress space have been developed. A methodology has been developed to input the experimentally determined composite failure surface in a tabulated manner.

A graphite front magnetic pole cover thruster configuration with the thruster body electrically tied to cathode, and an alumina front pole cover thruster configuration with the thruster body floating were evaluated. Both configurations were also evaluated at different facility background pressure conditions to evaluate background pressure effects on thruster operation. Performance characterization tests found that higher thruster performance was attained with the graphite front pole cover configuration with the thruster electrically tied to cathode. A total thrust efficiency of 68% and a total specific impulse of 2,820 s was demonstrated at a discharge voltage of 600 V and a discharge power of 12.5 kW. Thruster stability regimes were characterized with respect to the thruster discharge current oscillations and with maps of the discharge current-voltage-magnetic field (IVB). Analysis of TDU-1 discharge current waveforms found that lower normalized discharge current peak-to-peak and root mean square magnitudes were attained when the thruster was electrically floated with alumina front pole covers. Background pressure effects characterization tests indicated that the thruster performance and stability were mostly invariant to changes in the facility background pressure for vacuum chamber pressure below 110-5 Torr-Xe (for thruster flow rates of 20.5 mg/s). Power spectral density analysis of the discharge current waveforms showed that increasing the vacuum chamber background pressure resulted in a higher discharge current dominant breathing mode frequency. Finally, IVB maps of the TDU-1 thruster indicated that the discharge current became more oscillatory with higher discharge current peak-to-peak and RMS values with increased facility background pressure at lower thruster mass flow rates; thruster operation at higher flow rates resulted in less change to the thruster's IVB characteristics with elevated background pressure."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001283", "GRC-E-DAA-TN33862"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["AIAA/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference; 25-27 Jul. 2016; Salt Lake City, UT; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001283"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Spacecraft Propulsion and Power"], "subject.NASATerms": ["SYSTEMS ENGINEERING", "ELECTRIC PROPULSION", "HALL THRUSTERS", "HALL EFFECT", "PERFORMANCE TESTS", "SPECIFIC IMPULSE", "MAGNETIC SHIELDING", "PRESSURE EFFECTS", "ROCKET ENGINES", "THRUST", "OSCILLATIONS", "DIELECTRICS", "MAGNETIC FIELDS"], "subject.OtherDescriptors": ["Electric Propulsion", "Hall Thrusters", "Exploration Mission", "\n            \n          "], "title": ["Performance, Facility Pressure Effects, and Stability Characterization Tests of NASA's Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding Thruster"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

Removal of liquid condensate from the air stream exiting a condenser is readily performed here on Earth. In order to perform this function in space however, without gravity or mechanical action, other tactics including utilization of inertial, drag and capillary forces are required. Within the NC3, liquid water forms via condensation on cold condenser surfaces as humid air passes along multiple spiral channels, each in its own plane, all together forming a stacked plate assembly. Non-mechanical inertial forces are employed to transfer condensate, as it forms, via centripetal action to the outer perimeter of each channel. A V-shaped groove, constructed on this outer edge of the spiral channel, increases local capillary forces thereby retaining the liquid. Air drag then pulls the liquid along to a collection region near the center of the device. Dry air produced by each parallel spiral channel is combined in a common orthogonal, out-of-plane conduit passing down the axial center of the stacked device. Similarly, the parallel condensate streams are combined and removed from the condenser/separator through yet another out-of-plane axial conduit. NC3 is an integration of conventional finned condenser operation, combined with static phase separation and capillary transport phenomena. A Mars' transit mission would be a logical application for this technology where gravity is absent and the use of vibrating, energy-intensive, motor-driven centrifugal separators is undesired. Here a vapor stream from either the Heat Melt Compactor or the Carbon dioxide Reduction Assembly, for example, would be dried to a dew point of 10 deg using a passive NC3 condenser/separator with the precious water condensate recycled to the water bus."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001282", "GRC-E-DAA-TN33774"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES); 10-14 Jul. 2016; Vienna; Austria"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001282"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics"], "subject.NASATerms": ["FABRICATION", "INERTIA", "AIR FLOW", "CENTRIFUGING", "CONDENSATES", "MICROGRAVITY", "WATER RECLAMATION", "LIQUID AIR", "GRAVITATION", "DEW POINT", "SEPARATORS", "MARS MISSIONS", "FINNED BODIES", "TRANSPORT PROPERTIES"], "subject.OtherDescriptors": ["Separator", "Two Phase Flow", "\n            \n          "], "title": ["Demonstration of Nautilus Centripetal Capillary Condenser Technology"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

The cathode was operated with an anode that simulates the HERMeS hall thruster operating environment. Cathode discharge performance has been stable with the device accumulating 740 hours at the time of this report. Cathode operation (i.e. discharge voltage and orifice temperature) was repeatable during period variation of discharge current and flow rate. The details of the cathode assembly operation during the wear-test will be presented.

This increasing O3 trend combined with the high surface elevation of much of the western US, which aids mixing between boundary layer and free-troposphere, pose challenges in attaining the more stringent O3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) at many western US rural surface sites. As such, the ability to identify various sources and transport mechanisms that contribute towards surface O3 is increasingly important. This paper analyzes vertical profiles of O3 from the Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) over California and Nevada, ozonesondes from Trinidad Head, CA and tropospheric ozone profiles from the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) at the JPL Table Mountain Facility, CA. Surface O3 from the US EPA Clean air Status and Trends Network (CASNET) are used to discuss surface trends. GEOS-Chem determines the trends in regional O3 and assess the contributions of various sources on surface O3. And Realtime Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) is used to forecast and interpret free-tropospheric observations. Specifically we will address the following questions: What are the effects of the lowered NAAQS? Do we observe elevated O3 during 2012 at surface sites reported in previous studies? And if so, what are the causes? How variable is free-tropospheric O3 over California and Nevada? How frequently do we observe high O3 lamina in the free troposphere and what are the surface impacts?"], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001278", "ARC-E-DAA-TN38262"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["2016 AGU Fall Meeting ; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001278"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Environment Pollution", "Earth Resources and Remote Sensing"], "subject.NASATerms": ["ENVIRONMENT MODELS", "REAL TIME OPERATION", "ANNUAL VARIATIONS", "OZONE", "TROPOSPHERE", "BOUNDARY LAYERS", "ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION", "AIR QUALITY", "INTRUSION", "FORECASTING", "ELEVATION"], "subject.OtherDescriptors": ["tropospheric", "wildfires", "ozone", "\n            \n          "], "title": ["Western US Tropospheric Ozone: An Assessment of Vertical and Seasonal Variations over California and Nevada"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

In addition to the inherent uncertainties associated with forecasting extreme weather events, water planners need to anticipate water demands and water user behavior in a typical circumstances. This requires the use decision support systems capable of simulating agricultural water demand with the latest available data. Unfortunately, managers from local and regional agencies often use different datasets of variable quality, which complicates coordinated action. In previous work we have demonstrated novel methodologies to use satellite-based observational technologies, in conjunction with hydro-economic models and state of the art data assimilation methods, to enable robust regional assessment and prediction of drought impacts on agricultural production, water resources, and land allocation. These methods create an opportunity for new, cost-effective analysis tools to support policy and decision-making over large spatial extents. The methods can be driven with information from existing satellite-derived operational products, such as the Satellite Irrigation Management Support system (SIMS) operational over California, the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), and using a modified light-use efficiency algorithm to retrieve crop yield from the synergistic use of MODIS and Landsat imagery. Here we present an integration of this modeling framework in a client-server architecture based on the Hydra platform. Assimilation and processing of resource intensive remote sensing data, as well as hydrologic and other ancillary information occur on the server side. This information is processed and summarized as attributes in water demand nodes that are part of a vector description of the water distribution network. With this architecture, our decision support system becomes a light weight 'app' that connects to the server to retrieve the latest information regarding water demands, land use, yields and hydrologic information required to run different management scenarios. Furthermore, this architecture ensures all agencies and teams involved in water management use the same, up-to-date information in their simulations.

As NEX has been growing into a petabyte-size platform for analysis, experiments and data production, it has been increasingly important to enable users to easily retrace their steps, identify what datasets were produced by which process chains, and give them ability to readily reproduce their results. This can be a tedious and difficult task even for a small project, but is almost impossible on large processing pipelines. We have developed an initial reproducibility and knowledge capture solution for the NEX, however, if users want to move the code to another system, whether it is their home institution cluster, laptop or the cloud, they have to find, build and install all the required dependencies that would run their code. This can be a very tedious and tricky process and is a big impediment to moving code to data and reproducibility outside the original system. The NEX team has tried to assist users who wanted to move their code into OpenNEX on Amazon cloud by creating custom virtual machines with all the software and dependencies installed, but this, while solving some of the issues, creates a new bottleneck that requires the NEX team to be involved with any new request, updates to virtual machines and general maintenance support. In this presentation, we will describe a solution that integrates NEX and Docker to bridge the gap in code-to-data migration. The core of the solution is saemi-automatic conversion of science codes, tools and services that are already tracked and described in the NEX provenance system, to Docker - an open-source Linux container software. Docker is available on most computer platforms, easy to install and capable of seamlessly creating and/or executing any application packaged in the appropriate format. We believe this is an important step towards seamless process deployment in heterogeneous environments that will enhance community access to NASA data and tools in a scalable way, promote software reuse, and improve reproducibility of scientific results."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001275", "ARC-E-DAA-TN38171"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["2016 AGU Fall Meeting; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001275"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["Copyright, Distribution under U.S. Government purpose rights"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Earth Resources and Remote Sensing", "Computer Systems"], "subject.NASATerms": ["SUPERCOMPUTERS", "DATA STORAGE", "EARTH SCIENCES", "SOFTWARE REUSE", "CLIMATE", "MIGRATION", "DEPLOYMENT", "MAINTENANCE"], "subject.OtherDescriptors": ["earth exchange", "data", "supercomputing", "\n            \n          "], "title": ["Using Docker Containers to Extend Reproducibility Architecture for the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX)"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

They can aid water practitioners in decision-making for conservation efforts, multiyear storage retention, managing flood risk, downstream water releases, and regional growth planning. However, conventional methods are often limited in terms of their ability to incorporate non-stationarity, long run persistence, and the cross-correlation of multiple series in a region. This research aims to address these issues with a hybrid approach that integrates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with the Matalas multisite generation method. Multiple long-run inflows were examined for the Shasta/Trinity Reservoirs and Oroville Reservoir of California. EMD is used to decompose each inflow series into a set of independent intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that have different timescales and frequencies. These IMFs were grouped into intradecadal (less-than- 10-year average periodicity) and interdecadal (greater-than-10-year average periodicity) series for each site. The IMF projections at each site were then combined to produce replicates of the historical data. This preserves the correlation structure of the intra- and interdecadal components of the series. The hybrid EMD-Matalas method was compared to a traditional autoregressive lag-one model. Both methods were found to retain the statistical characteristics of the historical data. However, the EMD-Matalas method retained the multiyear wet and dry periods to a greater degree. This was examined by comparing the 5-year and 10-year sums from the traditional model with the hybrid EMD-Matalas model. An advantage of the EMD-Matalas method is the ability to explicitly incorporate modes of non-stationary long-run persistence often associated with large-scale climate drivers such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This contributes to scenario planning that may be particularly important for managing multiyear low flow periods."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001274", "ARC-E-DAA-TN38170"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["AGU Fall Meeting; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001274"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["Copyright, Distribution under U.S. Government purpose rights"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Earth Resources and Remote Sensing"], "subject.NASATerms": ["TRANSFORMATIONS (MATHEMATICS)", "WATER FLOW", "PERIODIC VARIATIONS", "WATER MANAGEMENT", "RESERVOIRS", "HYDROLOGY MODELS", "DATA PROCESSING", "HISTORIES", "SOUTHERN OSCILLATION", "EL NINO", "CLIMATE", "CALIFORNIA"], "subject.OtherDescriptors": ["inflow projections", "reservoir management", "empirical mode decomposition", "\n            \n          "], "title": ["California Reservoir Inflow Projections Using a Hybrid EMD-Matalas Method"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

We examine here the spatiotemporal variability and quantify the sources of tropospheric aerosols over the North Atlantic during the first two phases (November 2015 and May-June 2016) of NAAMES using a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The model is driven by the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). It includes sulfate-nitrate-ammonium aerosol thermodynamics coupled to ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon-aerosol chemistry, mineral dust, sea salt, elemental and organic carbon aerosols, and especially a recently implemented parameterization for the marine primary organic aerosol emission. The simulated aerosols over the North Atlantic are evaluated with available satellite (e.g., MODIS) observations of aerosol optical depths (AOD), and aircraft and ship aerosol measurements. We diagnose transport pathways for continental pollution outflow over the North Atlantic using carbon monoxide, an excellent tracer for anthropogenic pollution transport.

Amazon forests are crucial because of their role as the largest carbon sink in the world which would effect the global warming phenomena with decreased photosynthesis activity. Especially, after a decline in plant growth in 1.68 million km2 forest area during the once-in-a-century severe drought in 2010, it is of primary importance to understand the relationship between different climatic variables and vegetation. In an earlier study, we have shown that non-linear models are better at capturing the relation dynamics of vegetation and climate variables such as temperature and precipitation, compared to linear models. In this research, we learn precise models between vegetation and climatic variables (temperature, precipitation) for normal conditions in the Amazon region using genetic programming based symbolic regression. This is done by removing high elevation and drought affected areas and also considering the slope of the region as one of the important factors while building the model. The model learned reveals new and interesting ways historical and current climate variables affect the vegetation at any location. MAIAC data has been used as a vegetation surrogate in our study. For temperature and precipitation, we have used TRMM and MODIS Land Surface Temperature data sets while learning the non-linear regression model. However, to generalize the model to make it independent of the data source, we perform transfer learning where we regress a regularized least squares to learn the parameters of the non-linear model using other data sources such as the precipitation and temperature from the Climatic Research Center (CRU). This new model is very similar in structure and performance compared to the original learned model and verifies the same claims about the nature of dependency between these climate variables and the vegetation in the Amazon region. As a result of this study, we are able to learn, for the very first time how exactly different climate factors influence vegetation at any location in the Amazon rainforests, independent of the specific sources from which the data has been obtained."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001271", "ARC-E-DAA-TN38163"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["2016 AGU Fall Meeting; 12-16 Dec. 2016; San Francisco, CA; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001271"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["Copyright, Distribution under U.S. Government purpose rights"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Earth Resources and Remote Sensing"], "subject.NASATerms": ["CLIMATOLOGY", "LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE", "REGRESSION ANALYSIS", "RAIN FORESTS", "VEGETATION GROWTH", "GLOBAL WARMING", "AMAZON REGION (SOUTH AMERICA)", "MODIS (RADIOMETRY)", "DROUGHT", "VEGETATION", "CLIMATE"], "subject.OtherDescriptors": ["global warming", "climate", "carbon sink", "\n            \n          "], "title": ["IN11B-1621: Quantifying How Climate Affects Vegetation in the Amazon Rainforest"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

The aeroelastic study team decided treat both structural and aerodynamic input parameters as uncertain and represent them as samples drawn from statistical distributions, propagating them through aeroelastic analysis frameworks. Uncertainty quantification processes require many function evaluations to asses the impact of variations in numerous parameters on the vehicle characteristics, rapidly increasing the computational time requirement relative to that required to assess a system deterministically. The increased computational time is particularly prohibitive if high-fidelity analyses are employed.

A novel magnetic capture and latching mechanism is analyzed that allows for docking of two CubeSats without precise sensors and actuators. The proposed magnetic docking hardware not only provides the means to latch the CubeSats but it also significantly increases the likelihood of successful docking in the presence of relative attitude and position errors. The simplicity of the design allows it to be implemented on many CubeSat rendezvous missions. A CubeSat 3-DOF ground demonstration effort is on-going at NASA Langley Research Center that enables hardware-in-the loop testing of the autonomous approach and docking of a follower CubeSat to an identical leader CubeSat. The test setup consists of a 3 meter by 4 meter granite table and two nearly frictionless air bearing systems that support the two CubeSats. Four cold-gas on-off thrusters are used to translate the follower towards the leader, while a single reaction wheel is used to control the attitude of each CubeSat. An innovative modified pseudo inverse control allocation scheme was developed to address interactions between control effectors. The docking procedure requires relatively high actuator precision, a novel minimal impulse bit mitigation algorithm was developed to minimize the undesirable deadzone effects of the thrusters. Simulation of the ground demonstration shows that the Guidance, Navigation, and Control system along with the docking subsystem leads to successful docking under 3-sigma dispersions for all key system parameters. Extensive simulation and ground testing will provide sufficient confidence that the proposed docking mechanism along with the choosen suite of sensors and actuators will perform successful docking in the space environment.

The ability to incorporate aerothermodynamic considerations and TPS design into the early design phase is crucial, as both are closely coupled to the vehicle's aerodynamics, shape and mass. In the preliminary design stage, reasonably accurate results with rapid turn-representative entry envelope was explored. Initial results suggest that for Mach numbers ranging from 9-20, a few inviscid solutions could reasonably sup- port surface heating predictions at Mach numbers variation of +/-2, altitudes variation of +/-10 to 20 kft, and angle-of-attack variation of +/- 5. Agreement with Navier-Stokes solutions was generally found to be within 10-15% for Mach number and altitude, and 20% for angle of attack. A smaller angle-of-attack increment than the 5 deg around times for parametric studies and quickly evolving configurations are necessary to steer design decisions. This investigation considers the use of an unstructured 3D inviscid code in conjunction with an integral boundary-layer method; the former providing the flow field solution and the latter the surface heating. Sensitivity studies for Mach number, angle of attack, and altitude, examine the feasibility of using this approach to populate a representative entry flight envelope based on a limited set of inviscid solutions. Each inviscid solution is used to generate surface heating over the nearby trajectory space. A subset of a considered in this study is recommended. Results of the angle-of-attack sensitivity studies show that smaller increments may be needed for better heating predictions. The approach is well suited for application to conceptual multidisciplinary design and analysis studies where transient aeroheating environments are critical for vehicle TPS and thermal design. Concurrent prediction of aeroheating environments, coupled with the use of unstructured methods, is considered enabling for TPS material selection and design in conceptual studies where vehicle mission, shape, and entry strategies evolve rapidly."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001224", "NF1676L-24715"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["AIAA SciTech 2017; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001224"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["No Copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics"], "subject.NASATerms": ["BOUNDARY LAYERS", "AEROTHERMODYNAMICS", "DESIGN ANALYSIS", "AERODYNAMIC HEATING", "ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY", "AERODYNAMICS", "INVISCID FLOW", "ANGLE OF ATTACK", "MACH NUMBER", "THERMAL PROTECTION", "NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION"], "title": ["Inviscid/Boundary-Layer Aeroheating Approach for Integrated Vehicle Design"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

These standards require damage tolerance analyses with a minimum reliable detectible flaw/crack and demonstration of safe life four times the service life with these cracks at the worst-case location in the PVs and oriented perpendicular to the maximum principal tensile stress. The standards require consideration of semi-elliptical surface cracks in the range of aspect ratios (crack depth a to half of the surface length c, i.e., (a/c) of 0.2 to 1). NASA-STD-5009 provides the minimum reliably detectible standard crack sizes (90/95 probability of detection (POD) for several non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods (eddy current (ET), penetrant (PT), radiography (RT) and ultrasonic (UT)) for the two limits of the aspect ratio range required by the AIAA standards. This paper tries to answer the questions: can the safe life analysis consider only the life for the crack sizes at the two required limits, or endpoints, of the (a/c) range for the NDE method used or does the analysis need to consider values within that range? What would be an appropriate method to interpolate 90/95 POD crack sizes at intermediate (a/c) values? Several procedures to develop combinations of a and c within the specified range are explored. A simple linear relationship between a and c is chosen to compare the effects of seven different approaches to determine combinations of aj and cj that are between the (a/c) endpoints. Two of the seven are selected for evaluation: Approach I, the simple linear relationship, and a more conservative option, Approach III. For each of these two Approaches, the lives are computed for initial semi-elliptic crack configurations in a plate subjected to remote tensile fatigue loading with an R-ratio of 0.1, for an assumed material evaluated using NASGRO (registered 4) version 8.1. These calculations demonstrate that for this loading, using Approach I and the initial detectable crack sizes at the (a/c) endpoints in 5009 specified for the ET and UT NDE methods, the smallest life is not at the two required limits of the (a/c) range, but rather is at an intermediate configuration in the range (a/c) of 0.4 to 0.6. Similar analyses using both Approach I and III with the initial detectable crack size at the (a/c) endpoints in 5009 for PT NDE showed the smallest life may be at an (a/c) endpoint or an intermediate (a/c), depending upon which Approach is used. As such, analyses that interrogate only the two (a/c) values of 0.2 and 1 may result in unconservative life predictions.

A substantial portion of these energy savings come from beneficial aerodynamic-propulsion interaction. Previous research has shown the benefits of particular instantiations of distributed propulsion, such as the use of wingtip-mounted cruise propellers and leading edge high-lift propellers. However, these benefits have not been reduced to a generalized design or analysis approach suitable for large-scale design exploration. This paper discusses the rapid, \"design-order\" toolchains developed to investigate the large, complex tradespace of candidate geometries for the X-57. Due to the lack of an appropriate, rigorous set of validation data, the results of these tools were compared to three different computational flow solvers for selected wing and propulsion geometries. The comparisons were conducted using a common input geometry, but otherwise different input grids and, when appropriate, different flow assumptions to bound the comparisons. The results of these studies showed that the X-57 distributed propulsion wing should be able to meet the as-designed performance in cruise flight, while also meeting or exceeding targets for high-lift generation in low-speed flight.

Accompanying the plenoptic-PIV measurements were an ensemble of complementary stereo-PIV measurements. The stereo-PIV measurements were used as a truth measurement to assess the ability of the plenoptic-PIV system to capture relevant 3D/3C flow field features in the cylinder wake. Six individual tests were conducted as part of the test campaign using three different cylinder diameters mounted in two orientations in the tunnel test section. This work presents a comparison of measurements with the cylinders mounted horizontally (generating a 2D flow field in the x-y plane). Results show that in general the plenoptic-PIV measurements match those produced by the stereo-PIV system. However, discrepancies were observed in extracted pro les of the fuctuating velocity components. It is speculated that spatial smoothing of the vector fields in the stereo-PIV system could account for the observed differences.

Two stochastic model problems are used to demonstrate the developed methodologies: a transonic airfoil model and multidisciplinary aircraft analysis model. The results of both showed the multifidelity modeling approach was able to predict the output uncertainty predicted by the high-fidelity model as a significant reduction in computational cost."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001028", "NF1676L-24657"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["2017 AIAA SciTech Forum; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001028"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["No Copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Theoretical Mathematics", "Statistics and Probability", "Aerodynamics"], "subject.NASATerms": ["MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN OPTIMIZATION", "POLYNOMIALS", "COST ANALYSIS", "NUMERICAL ANALYSIS", "MATHEMATICAL MODELS", "UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS", "ACCURACY", "COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS", "AIRCRAFT MODELS", "STOCHASTIC PROCESSES", "AIRFOILS", "COMPARISON"], "title": ["Multifidelity, Multidisciplinary Design Under Uncertainty with Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

As part of the digital twin concept, methodologies are developed by using integrated multiphysics models, sensor information and input data from an in-service vehicle to mirror and predict the life of its corresponding physical twin. SHM tools are necessary for both damage diagnostics and prognostics for continued safe operation of damaged aircraft structures. The adverse conditions include loss of control caused by environmental factors, actuator and sensor faults or failures, and structural damage conditions. A major concern in these structures is the growth of undetected damage/cracks due to fatigue and low velocity foreign object impact that can reach a critical size during flight, resulting in loss of control of the aircraft. To avoid unstable, catastrophic propagation of damage during a flight, load levels must be maintained that are below a reduced load-carrying capacity for continued safe operation of an aircraft. Hence, a capability is needed for accurate real-time predictions of damage size and safe load carrying capacity for structures with complex damage configurations. In the present work, a procedure is developed that uses guided wave responses to interrogate damage. As the guided wave interacts with damage, the signal attenuates in some directions and reflects in others. This results in a difference in signal magnitude as well as phase shifts between signal responses for damaged and undamaged structures. Accurate estimation of damage size, location, and orientation is made by evaluating the cumulative signal responses at various pre-selected sensor locations using a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization procedure. The damage size, location, and orientation is obtained by minimizing the difference between the reference responses and the responses obtained by wave propagation finite element analysis of different representative cracks, geometries, and sizes."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001027", "NF1676L-24659"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["AIAA SciTech 2017; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001027"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["Copyright, Distribution as joint owner in the copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Avionics and Aircraft Instrumentation"], "subject.NASATerms": ["LOAD CARRYING CAPACITY", "STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING", "DAMAGE", "FINITE ELEMENT METHOD", "CHARACTERIZATION", "FLIGHT SAFETY", "POSITION (LOCATION)", "MATHEMATICAL MODELS", "WAVE PROPAGATION", "AIRCRAFT CONTROL", "SYSTEMS INTEGRATION", "DAMAGE ASSESSMENT", "REAL TIME OPERATION", "CRACK PROPAGATION", "HAZARDS", "GENETIC ALGORITHMS"], "title": ["Structural Health Management of Damaged Aircraft Structures Using the Digital Twin Concept"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

One aircraft design operational concept is the reduction of cruise speed to reduce fuel burned during a mission. Although this is not a new idea, it was used by all of the contractors involved in a 2008 NASA sponsored study that solicited concept and technology ideas to reduce environmental impacts for future subsonic passenger transports. NASA is currently improving and building new analysis capabilities to analyze advanced concepts. To test some of these new capabilities, a transonic truss braced wing configuration was used as a test case. This paper examines the effects due to changes in the design cruise speed and other tradeoffs in the design space. The analysis was baselined to the Boeing SUGAR High truss braced wing concept. An optimization was run at five different design cruise Mach numbers. These designs are compared to provide an initial assessment space and the parameters that should be considered when selecting a design cruise speed. A discussion of the design drivers is also included. The results show that the wing weight in the current analysis has more influence on the takeoff gross weight than expected. This effect caused lower than expected wing sweep angle values for higher cruise speed designs."], "format": ["application/pdf"], "identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20170001025", "NF1676L-24665"], "identifier.bibliographicCitation": ["AIAA SciTech 2017 ; 9-13 Jan. 2017; Grapevine, TX; United States"], "identifier.casi_id": ["20170001025"], "language": ["English"], "relation.requires": ["CASI"], "rights": ["No Copyright"], "rights.accessRights": [" Unclassified, Unlimited, Publicly available"], "subject": ["Aircraft Design, Testing and Performance"], "subject.NASATerms": ["SWEEP ANGLE", "PRODUCTIVITY", "TRUSSES", "LIFE CYCLE COSTS", "AERODYNAMIC CONFIGURATIONS", "MACH NUMBER", "WAVE DRAG", "WINGS", "INDUCED DRAG", "TRADEOFFS", "DRAG REDUCTION", "TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT"], "title": ["Cruise Speed Sensitivity Study for Transonic Truss Braced Wing"], "type": ["Conference Paper"]}

It calculates the reflected solar (RS) radiances with a fast coarse way and then, with the help of a pre-saved matrix, transforms the results to obtain the desired high accurate RS spectrum. The methodology has been demonstrated with the hybrid stream discrete ordinate (HSDO) radiative transfer (RT) model. The HSDO method calculates the monochromatic radiances using a 4-stream discrete ordinate method, where only a small number of monochromatic radiances are simulated with both 4-stream and a larger N-stream (N  16) discrete ordinate RT algorithm. The accuracy of the obtained channel radiance is comparable to the result from N-stream moderate resolution atmospheric transmission version 5 (MODTRAN5). The root-mean-square errors are usually less than 5x10(exp -4) mW/sq cm/sr/cm. The computational speed is three to four-orders of magnitude faster than the medium speed correlated-k option MODTRAN5.

This dataset was used as input to a radiative transfer model and the single scattering albedo (SSA) at 368 and 332 nm was calculated. Retrievals from a collocated CIMEL sun photometer were used to evaluate the products and study the absorption spectral behavior of retrieved SSA values. The UVMFR SSA, together with synchronous, CIMEL-derived retrievals of SSA at 440 nm, had a mean of 0.90, 0.87 and 0.83, with lowest values (higher absorption) encountered at the shorter wavelengths. In addition, noticeable diurnal variation of the SSA in all wavelengths is shown, with amplitudes up to 0.05. Strong SSA wavelength dependence is revealed for cases of low Angstrom exponents, accompanied by a SSA decrease with decreasing extinction optical depth, suggesting varying influence under different aerosol composition. However, part of this dependence for low aerosol optical depths is masked by the enhanced SSA retrieval uncertainty. Dust and brown carbon UV absorbing properties were also investigated to explain seasonal patterns.
